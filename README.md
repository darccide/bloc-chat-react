# Bloc Chat React Project

Bloc Chat is the second React Single Page Application (SPA) I built while going
through my apprenticeship at Bloc. It is an SPA for chatting that uses
Firebase for it's backend and Material UI to create a responsive page that also works on mobile devices. This is the first time I created a React application requiring a database. Building this application was a good way to explore using a dynamic database (Firebase) with React.

## Build Process

 First, I generated a list of chat rooms that updates dynamically when a new chat room is added by a user.Next, I displayed messages that are associated with each chat room. Lastly, to create messages as a registered user, Firebase was added for user authentication and to store user messages. Messages only are shown within the specific chat room in which they were created in. Messages and chat rooms can be edited and deleted.
 
 ### Note about styling
 
 Currently this app is mobile responsive, however it is currently best used on a desktop.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Javascript front-end library for UI (user
  interface) component rendering
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Backend as a service platform
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/): Mobile responsive styling
